# Design-of-a-Miller-compensated-Two-stage-Op-amp
Implemented a two-stage op-amp with differential input and single-ended output using NMOS input pairs.
Achieved closed loop 3dB bandwidth of 32.017 MHz, DC loop gain of 60.46 dB, phase margin of 66.03â—¦ all at 300 K,
with the load capacitance of 2 pF.
